#===--- JIT compilation notes --------------------------------------------===#

I've always wanted to work with JIT compilation because of its possible
performance benefits and (from my point of view) elegance.  I had a
somewhat working backend a year ago, but it was fragile (didn't work on
windows, and worked differently on mac and linux).  My current work is
focusing on a robust JIT using LLVM, as well as a playground for my
object-oriented system dynamics ideas.


#===--- general outline --------------------------------------------------===#

- load in runtime from .bc (generated from C file using clang)
- create sim-specific instances of data structures
- create function(s) to create and initialize new sim instances
  - a 'new' function to get a new initialized simulation instance
  - an 'init' function to initialize the stock initial values
    and space for data.
- create functions to both calcuate the flows and update the stocks.
- create and initialize sim instance, pass it to simulate runtime function

the ex.c file has a detailed example of how this will look.
