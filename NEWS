0.4.6 (Bobby Powers <bobby@laptop.org>)
===========================================================
preview version 0.4.6
    
    there has been a lot of visible work for 0.4.6, notably:
     * can get variables you've created from the simulator
     * arrowheads in diagrams!
     * loading and saving somewhat works again from gtk interface


0.4.5 (Bobby Powers <bobby@laptop.org>)
===========================================================
preview version 0.4.5 'keywords schmeawords'
    
    This release sees the 'saving' signal actually WORK on Fedora.  The 
    release name, 'keywords schmeawords' is an allusion to the fact that 
    keywords were causing my woes.  Python on Fedora was giving NULL kwargs, 
    which is different behavior for what it does on mac.
    
    Other small improvements include -
    * AS3 template corrections (thanks to Billy)
    * script to update activity libraries
    * whitespace improvements :)
    
    In addition, I've started work replacing the interpreter with a bytecode/C
    based one, but that will be a significant project.


0.4.4 (Bobby Powers <bobby@laptop.org>)
===========================================================
preview version 0.4.4
    
    Signals!  This release sees the 'saving' signal added to simulator, 
    and the ability to add metadata to a save file (using this signal) from 
    Python.


0.4.3 (Bobby Powers <bobby@laptop.org>)
===========================================================
preview version 0.4.3
    
    this release sees our wonderful gobject based simulator and variables 
    merged back into master.  from the command line, its functonally the 
    same as 0.3.1, but saving and model creation is broken in the visual 
    tools.


0.4.1 (Bobby Powers <bobby@laptop.org>)
===========================================================
preview version 0.4.1
    
    working gobject-codegen based python bindings!


0.4.0 (Bobby Powers <bobby@laptop.org>)
===========================================================
preview version 0.4.0
    
    major changes:
     * gobject based simulator and variable
     * python bindings based on gobject-codegen
     * no more swig
     * c-namespace changed from model- to opensim-
       - Model is the name of our graphical modeling program,
         it makes sense to keep the namespace as opensim so that
         we don't conflict with anything else in python


0.3.1 (Bobby Powers <bobby@laptop.org>)
===========================================================
model version 0.3.1
    
    this release has several new features:
     * ability to draw links
     * equation editing
     * simulation runs in own thread


0.3.0 (Bobby Powers <bobby@laptop.org>)
===========================================================
model version 0.3.0
    
    this release has two key feaures:
     * full load/save support
     * complete actionscript 3 model output
    
    Once again, anything you can draw in Model you can save and load. Until 
    now save files didn't support loading rates, and the save format for 
    rates has changed. Also, with some debugging help from Billy, we now 
    have complete and working AS3 model output. You can output your model 
    in AS3 for use in Flash.  In fact, the AS3 simulator currently has more 
    features than the C++ one, such as partial simulation and ability to 
    change variables.


0.2.9 (Bobby Powers <bobby@laptop.org>)
===========================================================
OpenSim/Model 0.2.9 preview release
    
    With this release comes a major improvement in the AS3 backend.
    We now produce syntatically correct AS3, composed of output
    produced from parsing the AST being inserted into a template
    containing much of the ActionScript functionality.


0.2.8 (Bobby Powers <bobby@laptop.org>)
===========================================================
release version 0.2.8
    
    major features:
     * activity builds from release distribution
     * draws stocks, flows and aux variables
     * can rename stocks and aux vars
     * can rearrange the scene
     * can save the visual scene, load somewhat broken


0.2.6 (Bobby Powers <bobby@laptop.org>)
===========================================================
engine compiles on Windows, Linux and Mac


0.2.4 (Bobby Powers <bobby@laptop.org>)
===========================================================
initial Python support via SWIG
    
    major work was done on the python front:
     * Python model output now respects the specified savestep
     * Python wrappers for the simulator are generated and installed 
       through SWIG
     * simple example Python script added to src to show how to use the
       simulator in Python

0.2.3 (Bobby Powers <bobby@laptop.org>)
===========================================================
Can run Vensim's Rabbit/Fox model.  Basic support for lookup tables 
and built-in functions


Preview 1 (0.1.0) (2008-03-30 Bobby Powers <bobbypowers@gmail.com>)
===========================================================
This is the first preview release of OpenSim.  The main feature that
is complete is outputting Python code from XML input files.  The
included example file, 'simplepopulation.osm', can be opened, parsed,
and output in Python or in (incomplete and broken) LLVM-IR.  As the 
release name suggests, this is a preview intended to show that we're
working and making progress significant progress.  Release early, 
release often!
