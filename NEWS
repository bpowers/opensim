Preview 1 (0.1.0) (2008-03-30 Bobby Powers <bobbypowers@gmail.com>)
===========================================================
This is the first preview release of OpenSim.  The main feature that
is complete is outputting Python code from XML input files.  The
included example file, 'simplepopulation.osm', can be opened, parsed,
and output in Python or in (incomplete and broken) LLVM-IR.  As the 
release name suggests, this is a preview intended to show that we're
working and making progress significant progress.  Release early, 
release often!
